Hi! Iâ€™m Bang Nguyen, a Ph.D. student at the [Smart Power System and Control Lab](https://www.spsc-lab.com/) at Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Clarkson University. I received my B.S and Msc. in electrical engineering from Vietnam National University HoChiminh City - University of Technology, respectively. In 2015, I was with the Eastern International Univeristity, Binh Duong New City, Vietnam as a lecturer. From 2016 to 2018, I was a research assistant in the [Power Electronics and Energy Conversion Lab](http://peec.knu.kr/), Kyungpook National University, South Korea.

Most of my previous work has focused on design and control power converters and related applications included designing of gate driver and magnetic circuits. I had worked on active filter and multi-level inverter during my master program. For my time in South Korea, I had worked on multi-port converters and dual-active-bridge converter.

Currently, I works on the control and management of microgrids using machine learning tools. State estimation and anomaly detection technies are my focusing. I started from the model-based approaches and trying to attack the data-driven methods.
